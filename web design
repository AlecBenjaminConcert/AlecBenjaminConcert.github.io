	<h2>Why I like Alec Benjamin</h2>
		<p>Here is a quote from someone who listens to Alec Benjamin. <q>I personally listen to Alec Benjamin's music and got excited when I got an email about his upcoming tour. I live in Wisconsin so the best place for me to go see him would be madison wisconsin or minneapolis minnesota. I like his music because it is very artistic and he has a beautiful voice. His music also has a lot of underlying messages you might not understand the first time listening. He overall seems like a genuine and nice person who makes good music and has fun in his life.</q>-Emma McCaffrey</p>
